# Music-genre-classification-based-on-Cepstral-Analysis
It is the problem of identifying to
which of a set of classes a song belongs, using a training set of genres already classified. Perrot and Gjerdingen
[2] conducted a study where college student were tested to make music genre classification among a total of ten
music genres. The study showed that humans with little to moderate musical training can achieve up to 70%
classification accuracy. Another study [2] conducted the experiment on 27 human listeners, each listening to the
central 30 seconds of a music track and received inter-participant genre classification of 76%. Genre
classification requires empiric knowledge and familiarity with a set of songs to accurately classify them. There
are different approaches to solving the classification problem. The project rely on the Cepstral analysis â€“ a
content-based analysis of the music signal.
